This seems to be different to how many !pet commands are set up because it can accept 0-n arguments (where n is the number of pets to choose from).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I will break this guide up into a two main parts: Action Groups and the Command.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Action Groups&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have one Action Group for each pet that the Command will use. I chose to use Action Groups now because it gives me the ability to re-use the individual pet actions anywhere else I may want them, but I originally created them because my first draft of this command was repeating the pet actions in multiple places, which can be a hassle to update each time. I have since simplified this, but feel free to put this logic into the Command itself. The process will be the same either way.&lt;/p&gt;</description> <link>https://www.mellypop.gay/blog/2024/02/07/mixitup-multi-pet-command/</link> <pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 04:07:59 +0000</pubDate> <source url="https://www.mellypop.gay/feed_rss_updated.xml">Mellifluous Musings</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.mellypop.gay/blog/2024/02/07/mixitup-multi-pet-command/</guid> </item> <item> <title>MixItUp PNGTuber Roulette</title> <category>MixItUp</category> <category>Streaming</category> <category>miu</category> <category>mix it up</category> <category>streaming</category> <category>tutorial</category> <category>twitch</category> <description>&lt;p&gt;!!! note These instructions are for an early version of the PNGTuber Roulette used in &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitch.tv/perhapssam&#34;&gt;PerhapsSam&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s streams. I will put together a newer tutorial once I have worked out this issues with it. The new version uses MixItUp&#39;s timer widgets, which will allow showing countowns of time left for each PNGTuber.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was asked to set up a roulette to choose a random PNGTuber as a Twitch channel point redeem. After watching a couple YouTube tutorials on how to change a PNGTuber with MixItUp, I came up with something that works fairly well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The process here can be broken down into five basic steps: set a hotkey in your PNGTuber application, generate a random number, use that number to select a PNGTuber, wait for a set amount of time, and revert back to the default avatar.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So first, we need a hotkey, and we need this because we will tell MixItUp to press this hotkey, which will change our PNGTuber to the one that was randomly selected. You will need one for your default avatar and one for each of the available options.&lt;/p&gt;</description> <link>https://www.mellypop.gay/blog/2024/01/17/mixitup-pngtuber-roulette/</link> <pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 04:07:59 +0000</pubDate> <source url="https://www.mellypop.gay/feed_rss_updated.xml">Mellifluous Musings</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.mellypop.gay/blog/2024/01/17/mixitup-pngtuber-roulette/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Plex Account Setup</title> <category>Plex</category> <category>plex</category> <description>&lt;h1&gt;Plex Account Setup&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Plex is an online media streaming service that lets users set up a server to host their own media.
