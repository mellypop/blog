This seems to be\ndifferent to how many !pet commands are set up because it can accept 0-n\narguments (where n is the number of pets to choose from).</p>\n<p>I will break this guide up into a two main parts: Action Groups and the Command.</p>\n<h2>Action Groups</h2>\n<p>I have one Action Group for each pet that the Command will use. I chose to use\nAction Groups now because it gives me the ability to re-use the individual pet\nactions anywhere else I may want them, but I originally created them because my\nfirst draft of this command was repeating the pet actions in multiple places,\nwhich can be a hassle to update each time. I have since simplified this, but\nfeel free to put this logic into the Command itself. The process will be the same\neither way.</p>", "image": null, "date_published": "2024-02-07T00:00:00+00:00", "authors": [], "tags": ["MixItUp", "Streaming", "miu", "mix it up", "streaming", "tutorial", "twitch"]}, {"id": "https://www.mellypop.gay/blog/2024/01/17/mixitup-pngtuber-roulette/", "url": "https://www.mellypop.gay/blog/2024/01/17/mixitup-pngtuber-roulette/", "title": "MixItUp PNGTuber Roulette", "content_html": "<p>!!! note\n    These instructions are for an early version of the PNGTuber Roulette used in\n    <a href=\"https://twitch.tv/perhapssam\">PerhapsSam</a>'s streams.

After watching a couple YouTube tutorials on how to change a\nPNGTuber with MixItUp, I came up with something that works fairly well.</p>\n<p>The process here can be broken down into five basic steps: set a hotkey in your\nPNGTuber application, generate a random number, use that number to select a\nPNGTuber, wait for a set amount of time, and revert back to the default avatar.</p>\n<p>So first, we need a hotkey, and we need this because we will tell MixItUp to\npress this hotkey, which will change our PNGTuber to the one that was randomly\nselected.
